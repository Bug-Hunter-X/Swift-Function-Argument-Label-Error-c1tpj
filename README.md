This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: forgetting argument labels when calling functions with labeled parameters. The `bug.swift` file shows the incorrect code, resulting in a compiler error.  The `bugSolution.swift` file provides the corrected version. This is a useful example for understanding Swift's function parameter labeling and how to avoid this type of error.
